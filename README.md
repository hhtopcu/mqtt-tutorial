#MQTT Tutorial
MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol. It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport

In order to show the subscrivers to topics, we can directly query from the MongoDB with the following

> db.ascoltatori.find().pretty()


## Dependencies

> npm install mosca --save
> npm install mqtt --save
